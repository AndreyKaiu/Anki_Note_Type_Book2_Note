# Anki_Note_Type_Book2_Note
The Book2_Note_V and Book2_Note_Ph note types are specifically designed for memorizing words and phrases downloaded from www.goethe-verlag.com (This repository also includes the media file loader code).

You can download two sample decks from GitHub (they do not contain all media files). Alternatively, you can download all the links to the Anki decks (.apkg file extension) from https://schoolpmr.info/?p=4174 – 16 languages ​​in total – to fully evaluate the usefulness of this note design.

The following goals were set for this project: to create decks of cards for the Anki program to eliminate the need for constant internet connection; to implement the ability to play back phrases being studied in slow motion; to implement methods for increasing concentration on words being studied (background, frame, animation); to increase the automation of playback of both the current word and previously shown words, as well as translations from other languages; to ensure the ability to work seamlessly in the Anki desktop application, the web version (ankiuser.net/study), and the AnkiDroid Android app.

You can see the note design in the photo below.
